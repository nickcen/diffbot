  "text": "Diffbot's human wranglers are proud today to announce the release of our newest product: an API for... products!\nThe Product API can be used for extracting clean, structured data from any e-commerce product page. It automatically makes available all the product data you'd expect: price, discount/savings amount, shipping cost, product description, any relevant product images, SKU and/or other product IDs.\nEven cooler: pair the Product API with Crawlbot, our intelligent site-spidering tool, and let Diffbot determine which pages are products, then automatically structure the entire catalog. Here's a quick demonstration of Crawlbot at work:\nWe've developed the Product API over the course of two years, building upon our core vision technology that's extracted structured data from billions of web pages, and training our machine learning systems using data from tens of thousands of unique shopping sites. We can't wait for you to try it out.\nWhat are you waiting for? Check out the Product API documentation and dive on in! If you need a token, check out our pricing and plans (including our Free plan).\nQuestions? Hit us up at support@diffbot.com ."
